Hello League of Extraordinary Algorithmes/Data Science with Python!

This is the code we will be working to complete on Saturday August 26th. This is a basic RL project with some key pieces removed that
we will fill back in on Saturday. This was my first RL project so it is by no means a work of art. We will be going through
some of the key concepts in RL that will help get us started and completing the code.

As a heads up:
-I'm using python 3.6 and developed this using spyder 3
-I'm still a little new back into python so my PEP8 may be a little lacking

Hope to see you all there!
